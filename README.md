======================
As Pat, I can view the upcoming movies from [Rotten Tomatoes](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs), so that I can make sure I know about movies coming up before my friends do. I want to know as much about the movies as I can in a list to easily scroll through them on my lunch hour. I have both an iPhone and a laptop and might use either to access this website.
  
* Use the following API key to access the Rotten Tomatoes API: vymecugmgctsrxbbbmztpnb9
* The URL for the upcoming movies API call is http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/upcoming.json?apikey=[api key]
* Acceptance Criteria: Information is refreshed from the RT API every time the page is visited.
    
As Pat, I can select favorite upcoming movies and save them to my favorites.
  
* Acceptance Criteria: Favorite list is saved and persists between visits.
   
As Pat, I can read additional information about a movie, so that I can learn more about the movie and its cast.
 
* This will require using additional API calls beyond the Upcoming Movies API
* Acceptance Criteria: I'm able to see a photo of the movie, title, release information and cast information
   
As Pat, I can filter movies by release date and critic rating.
  
* Acceptance Criteria: Filtered lists only return matching movies.
